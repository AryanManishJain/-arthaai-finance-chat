# ArthaAI Finance Chat
A clean starter for building a **finance-only AI assistant** with preloaded **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** frontend and a lightweight **Node/Express backend**.
## What this project now includes
- Working frontend chat UI (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).
- Finance mode selector (general, startup, investing, budgeting, tax).
- Backend endpoint: `POST /api/chat`.
- Finance-topic gate (rejects non-finance prompts).
- Safety guardrails for risky/illegal or “guaranteed returns” style requests.
- Educational disclaimer in responses.

## Quick start
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
Open: `http://localhost:3000`

## How to build a “100% finance AI” (practical path)
You can’t make any AI truly “100% perfect,” but you *can* make it strong, safe, and finance-specialized.

### 1) Keep frontend as the base
Use your existing:
- `index.html` for structure.
- `style.css` for UX clarity and trust.
- `script.js` for sending user prompts to backend.

### 2) Move intelligence to backend
Never place API keys in frontend JavaScript.
- Keep all model calls in `server.js` (or service layer).
- Validate and sanitize input before model call.
- Add request limits and logging.

### 3) Add strict finance system policy
Every model request should include policy instructions such as:
- Stay in finance domain.
- No guaranteed returns.
- No illegal guidance (fraud, insider trading, tax evasion).
- Educational, explain assumptions.
- Show uncertainty where data is missing.

### 4) Build a retrieval layer (RAG)
Use trusted sources and your own knowledge base:
- Regulator docs, product docs, internal SOPs, investment policy.
- Store docs in vector DB.
- Inject citations into responses.

### 5) Add risk and suitability checks
Before returning advice, ask for:
- Goal amount and deadline.
- Income/cash-flow stability.
- Emergency fund status.
- Debt obligations.
- Risk tolerance.

### 6) Add compliance + human escalation
- Show disclaimer in-app.
- For tax/legal/complex planning: suggest licensed professional review.
- Keep audit logs for sensitive recommendations.

### 7) Measure quality continuously
Track:
- Hallucination rate.
- Refusal correctness.
- User follow-through and outcomes.
- Satisfaction by topic.

Run red-team prompt suites weekly.

## Suggested next improvements (you asked for improvements)
1. Plug in a real LLM provider in backend with env keys.
2. Add user profile + conversation memory in database.
3. Add calculator tools (SIP, EMI, runway, debt payoff).
4. Add chart components for portfolio/budget trends.
5. Add auth + role-based access for advisor workflows.
6. Add automated tests for domain guardrails and unsafe prompts.

If you want, next step I can implement:
- OpenAI/Anthropic backend integration,
- structured JSON response format,
- and a complete prompt policy module.
